# Quantium-Retail-Analytics

Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. Here are the analyses within the Quantium analytics team for delivering highly valued insights to help the business make strategic decisions.

Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customerâ€™s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful.

This program contains 3 main tasks with following key analytics skills:
  1. Data preparation and customer analytics (data validation, data visualisation, data wrangling, programming)
  2. Experimentation and uplift testing (data analysis, commercial thinking, statistical testing)
  3. Analytics and commercial application (using insights from previous tasks to prepare a report for client, the Category Manager)
